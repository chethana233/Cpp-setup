4. How to make <bits/stdc++.h> work?
Cmd + shift + H -> click on Macintosh HD 
	In the finder -> Go -> Go to folder -> usr/local/include
[if you don’t have a include folder in local, create one]
Create a bits folder in it
Create a stdc++.h file in it 
https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/precompiled/stdc%2B%2B.h (copy this into the stdc++.h file and you’re done)

5. Taking user input and output
Create input.txt, output.txt files. Now the contents of your main function should be changed to what’s below.
int main() {
   #ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
   freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
   freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
   #endif
}
